# ColorRush
A videogame created through python that helps in the training of muscle and short-term memory
The main objective in the game is to recreate a color pattern by clicking on the circles of the corresponding color. If completed correctly, the player will level up and another color will be added to the same pattern. The score will increase by 200 points per color selected correctly. However, the player will loose if the incorrect color is selected or doesn't complete the pattern before the circles disappear from the screen.
